## How to Use SMTP with Hostinger

Hostinger recommends using PHPMailer for reliable email sending. Download it as a ZIP from https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer, extract the files, and upload the extracted folder to your /public_html directory. Then, rename the folder from PHPMailer-master to PHPMailer.

In Hostinger's control panel, go to Email > Email Accounts to get SMTP server, username, and password.

Use a PHP mailer script like PHPMailer, and configure with those credentials (sendmail.php).
