## How to Use SMTP with Hostinger

Hostinger recommends PHPMailer for reliable sending, download it from: https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer

In Hostinger's control panel, go to Email > Email Accounts to get SMTP server, username, and password.

Use a PHP mailer script like PHPMailer, and configure with those credentials.
